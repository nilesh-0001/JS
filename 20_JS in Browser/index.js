// In this session we are gonna talk about the JavaScript in Browser 

// It was basically created for adding functionality in our Website 

// Javascript ability in the browser is very limited to protect the user info and safety 

// A website needs three things to stand 
// HTML
// CSS
// JavaScript 

// Devloper mode 
// Every browser has some developer tools 
// Press F12 to open Developer tools 

// note("It was for the frontend Work only")

// We can also run JavaScript command  in the console 
//  or 
// Using script tag to insert js into an Html page
