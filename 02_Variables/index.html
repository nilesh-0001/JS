        Variables are those who act like a container which can store type of
        datatype in it like (string,array and etc)
      </p>
      <div>
        The value of a Javascript Variable can be change during the execution of
        a program
      </div>
      <div>We have to follow some rules while writting the program and that rules was called syntax</div>
      <p>Javascript is also a case sensitive language </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            console.log("this session is all about variables and datatypes , syntax");
            // var a = 89; // a contains 89
            // But we have to use let in the place of var in most of the time 
            let a  = 89
            console.log(a)
            a = "nishu"
            console.log(a)

            // let 89Nishu = 78 // It was a error coz we cannot name any variable with a number

            // let var = "Nishu" // we cannot use reserved names in JavaScript
