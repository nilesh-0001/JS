      <h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
      <div class="info">
        Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the
        concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form
        of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A common feature of
        objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and
        modify the object's data fields.

    <h3>OOPS Four Pillars</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <p>
        Hiding the details, ex - I make a function which do some specific task
        so i gave him to the junior to run and call it, he does,t know anything
        in the function.
      </p>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <p>
        It means whwn we take multiple things and add all it to the one fuction
        to do something.
      </p>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <p>When we upgrade anything and make it better than before.</p>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
      <p>When your project can do multiple tasks</p>
    </ol>
