## Quick Notes

### Using `prompt()` and `alert()`
If youâ€™re trying to use `prompt()` or `alert()` in a Node.js environment (like most editors), they wonâ€™t work because theyâ€™re browser-specific features. But donâ€™t worry! Here are some ways to run them:

1. **Link Your JavaScript File to an HTML File:**
   - Create an HTML file and use the `<script>` tag to link your JS file.
   - Open the HTML file in any browser, and youâ€™re good to go.

2. **Use the Browser Console:**
   - Open your browserâ€™s developer tools (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
   - Go to the **Console** tab and run your JavaScript code there.

3. **Try Online Platforms:**
   - Websites like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), [CodePen](https://codepen.io), or [Replit](https://replit.com) let you run JavaScript with full support for `prompt()` and `alert()`.
