// Operators in JS

// Arithmetic operator

let a = 5
let b = 4
// Addition operator
console.log("a + b = ",a+b)

// subtraction operator
console.log("a - b = ",a-b)

// division operator
console.log("a / b = ",a/b)

// multiplication operator
console.log("a * b = ",a*b)

// exponention operator
console.log("a ** b = ",a**b)

// modulus operator
console.log("a % b = ",a%b)

// decrement operator
console.log("a-- = ",a--)

// increment operator
console.log("a++ = ",a++)

// increment operator
console.log("++a = ",++a)

// decrement operator
console.log("--a= ",--a)

// Assigment operator

let assignment = 1;
assignment +=5 // same as assignment = assignment + 5
console. log("a is now = ", assignment)
assignment -= 5 // same as assignment = assignment - 5
console. log( "a is now = ", assignment)
assignment *= 5 // same as assignment = assignment * 5
console. log( "a is now = ", assignment)
assignment /= 5 // same as assignment = assignment / 5
console. log("a is now = ", assignment)


// Comparison operator

let comp = 1
let comp2 = 6

// equal to
console.log("comp == comp2 is ", comp == comp2)

// not equal
console.log("comp != comp2 is ", comp != comp2)

// equal Value and type
console.log("comp === comp2 is ", comp === comp2)

// not equal Value either not equal type
console.log("comp !== comp2 is ", comp !== comp2)

// Greater than
console.log("comp > comp2 is ", comp > comp2)


// Logical Operator 

let x = 9
let y  = 11

// Logical and 
console.log(x<y && x!=y)

//Logical or
console.log(x>y || x!=y)

// Logical not 
console.log(!false) //It was gonna change the false into true
console.log(!true) //It was gonna change the false into false

// 9 + 7 = 15 

// 9 and 7 both are operands 
// and the signs like + = are operators 



//USECASE OF COMMENTS
// Comment in Javascript are very useful it is used when you want to add any text in your code but dont want the text to be a part of the code 

// it is used to make a single line comment in js for applying this use [cntrl + /]
